## Overview

Modern recruitment systems increasingly rely on AI for evaluating candidates, yet job-seekers rarely receive AI-assisted guidance to improve their performance. Studies show that 67% of job-seekers feel unprepared for behavioural interviews, and 54% struggle to articulate technical knowledge under pressure.

AI MockPrep addresses this by providing a unified system that no existing tool offers — combining interview simulation, real-time scoring, speech analysis, an ATS resume builder, and multi-domain question generation in a single platform.

### How It Compares

| Tool | Strength | Gap |
|------|----------|-----|
| Google Interview Warmup | Strong NLP questions | No behavioural scoring |
| Huru AI | Body language scoring | No ATS resume support |
| Final Round AI | Avatar interaction | Limited domain depth |
| Pramp | Peer interviews | Not AI-driven |
| **AI MockPrep** | **All of the above, unified** | — |

## Features

### Interview Simulation
- Dynamic interview creation based on role, experience level (Junior / Mid / Senior), and tech stack
- 8 AI-generated or curated questions per session tailored to the selected domain
- Voice-based interviews via VAPI AI or text-based input mode
- Real-time question delivery with 60-second timeout management
- Question preview before the interview begins
- FAANG-specific quick-start templates (Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft)

### AI-Powered Feedback
- Per-question scoring (0-10) with comparison to ideal answers
- Comprehensive final assessment with an overall score (0-100)

## System Architecture

AI MockPrep uses a layered architecture:

```
Frontend UI (Next.js 15 / React 19)
        |
  Speech Capture Engine (VAPI AI + AssemblyAI)
        |
    NLP Core (Hugging Face Mistral-7B / Google Gemini)
        |
   Scoring Module (Weighted, interview-type-aware)
        |
    Database (Firebase Firestore)
        |
   Resume Engine (Keyword extraction + ATS scoring)
```

- **Frontend:** Next.js App Router with route groups for auth, root, and support pages
- **Backend:** Next.js Server Actions and API routes
- **AI Layer:** NLP question generator, speech-to-text module, LLM evaluator for relevance, clarity, confidence, and technical depth
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore storing users, interviews, and feedback
- **Resume Engine:** Keyword extraction and composite ATS scoring

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Backend | Next.js Server Actions, Next.js API Routes |
| Database | Firebase Firestore |
| Authentication | Firebase Auth, Google OAuth |
| AI - Questions | Hugging Face Inference API (Mistral-7B-Instruct) |
| AI - Feedback | Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5-Flash) |
| AI - Resume | Google Generative AI (Gemini 3-Flash) |
| Voice AI | VAPI AI |
| Speech-to-Text | AssemblyAI (universal-3-pro model) |
| File Parsing | pdfjs-dist (PDF), mammoth (DOCX) |
| UI Components | Radix UI, Lucide React, Framer Motion |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Forms | React Hook Form, Zod |
| Email | Nodemailer, Resend |
| Notifications | Sonner |

## AI & ML Integrations

### Question Generation
Uses Hugging Face's Mistral-7B-Instruct model to generate role-specific, level-appropriate interview questions. Falls back to a curated CSV question bank when the API is unavailable.

### Real-Time Answer Analysis
Google Gemini 1.5-Flash evaluates each candidate response on a 0-10 scale with strict evaluation rules, producing feedback, correct answer templates, strengths, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions. A final analysis aggregates all responses into an overall assessment with a hiring recommendation.

### Speech Analytics Pipeline
AssemblyAI transcribes audio with word-level timestamps. The system computes WPM, filler word frequency, and hesitation pauses. Google Gemini then generates coaching feedback with a clarity score and actionable improvement steps.

### Resume Analysis Engine
Google Gemini 3-Flash performs deep resume-to-job-description matching. It evaluates keyword coverage, semantic alignment, bullet point impact, skills fit, experience relevance, and format compliance, producing a composite ATS score.

## Scoring Model

The scoring module adapts evaluation weights based on interview type:

**Coding / DSA:**
- Problem Understanding 25% | Logic 30% | Correctness 30% | Efficiency 15%

**Technical Round:**
- Technical Accuracy 40% | Communication 35% | Problem-Solving 20% | Confidence 5%

**Behavioural Interview:**
- Communication 35% | STAR Structure 40% | Tone & Professionalism 25%

**Aptitude Test:**
- Accuracy 50% | Reasoning 30% | Speed 20%
