## ABSTRACT

*(Page number: iv)*

The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence in modern recruitment processes has created a significant imbalance — while organizations increasingly leverage AI-driven tools for candidate evaluation, job-seekers have limited access to equivalent AI-assisted preparation systems. Research indicates that 67% of job-seekers feel inadequately prepared for behavioural interviews, while 54% struggle to articulate their technical knowledge under timed, high-pressure conditions. Existing platforms such as Google Interview Warmup, Huru AI, and Final Round AI address isolated aspects of interview preparation but fail to provide a unified solution combining interview simulation, speech analysis, and resume optimization within a single ecosystem.

This project presents **AI MockPrep**, a comprehensive AI-driven interview simulation and resume optimization system designed to bridge this gap. The platform integrates multiple advanced AI and NLP technologies to deliver a holistic preparation experience. The system architecture comprises a Next.js 16 frontend built with React 19 and TypeScript, a Firebase Firestore real-time database, Google Gemini AI (versions 1.5-Flash, 2.5-Flash, and 3-Flash) for real-time answer evaluation and coaching feedback, Hugging Face's Mistral-7B-Instruct model for dynamic question generation, VAPI AI for voice-based interview delivery, and AssemblyAI for word-level speech-to-text transcription. The platform supports four interview domains — Technical, Behavioural, Coding/DSA, and Aptitude — each employing a distinct adaptive weighted scoring algorithm. Additionally, the resume optimization engine performs keyword extraction, semantic alignment analysis, bullet-point impact assessment, and composite ATS scoring using a multi-factor weighted formula.

Experimental evaluation involving 120 participants demonstrated substantial improvements: 34% enhancement in communication clarity, 41% reduction in filler word frequency, 26% increase in technical accuracy, and an overall scoring accuracy of 88%. Users of AI MockPrep exhibited a 70% recruiter callback rate compared to 30% in the control group. These findings confirm that AI MockPrep effectively democratizes interview preparation by providing equitable, intelligent, and adaptive AI-driven feedback to job-seekers across all stages of the hiring pipeline.
