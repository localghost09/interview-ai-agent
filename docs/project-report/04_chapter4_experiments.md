## 4.1 Methodology

The development of AI MockPrep followed an Agile/Iterative methodology, enabling rapid prototyping, continuous integration of AI services, and incremental feature delivery. The methodology was structured into four principal phases, each comprising multiple iterative sprints.

**[INSERT FIGURE 16: Agile Development Methodology Flowchart]**

### 4.1.1 Development Phases

**Phase 1 — Requirement Analysis & Planning (August 2025 – September 2025):**
During this phase, the project team conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing interview preparation tools, surveyed 50 students from MGMCET Noida to identify preparation pain points, reviewed academic literature on NLP-based evaluation systems, and defined the system requirements specification (SRS). Key deliverables included the project proposal, feature prioritization matrix, and initial technology stack selection.

**Phase 2 — System Design & Architecture (September 2025 – October 2025):**
This phase focused on architectural design including the six-layer system architecture, database schema design, API endpoint specification, component hierarchy definition, and UI/UX wireframing. The team evaluated multiple AI service providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, Hugging Face, Anthropic Claude) and selected the current multi-model architecture based on cost efficiency, API reliability, and task-specific performance benchmarks.

**Phase 3 — Model Integration & Development (October 2025 – February 2026):**
The core development phase comprised multiple two-week sprints:
- Sprint 1–2: Project scaffolding (Next.js 16 setup, Firebase integration, authentication system)
- Sprint 3–4: Interview creation and question generation module (HuggingFace integration, CSV fallback)
- Sprint 5–6: Real-time answer evaluation (Gemini 1.5-Flash integration, scoring algorithm)
- Sprint 7–8: Voice interview integration (VAPI AI), interview interface refinement
- Sprint 9–10: Resume analysis engine (file parsing, Gemini 3-Flash, ATS scoring)
- Sprint 11–12: Speech analytics pipeline (AssemblyAI, Gemini 2.5-Flash coaching)
- Sprint 13–14: UI polish, responsive design, landing page, support pages

**Phase 4 — Testing & Evaluation (February 2026 – April 2026):**
This phase involved systematic testing across multiple dimensions (detailed in Section 4.4), the controlled experimental study with 120 participants (detailed in Section 4.5), and iterative bug fixing and performance optimization based on test results.

### 4.1.2 Tools and Practices

The team employed the following Agile practices:
- **Version Control:** Git with GitHub for collaborative development, branching strategy (main/develop/feature branches)
- **Task Management:** GitHub Issues and Projects for sprint planning and progress tracking
- **Code Review:** Mandatory peer review for all pull requests before merging to develop branch
- **Continuous Integration:** Automatic Vercel deployments on push to main branch
- **Communication:** Weekly team standups and bi-weekly supervisor meetings with Dr. Neelam Shrivastava

## 4.3 Implementation Details

### 4.3.1 Key Module Implementations

**Real-Time Answer Evaluation (from `lib/realTimeAnalysis.ts`):**

The `RealTimeAnalysisService` class implements two core methods. The `analyzeAnswer` method evaluates individual responses:

```typescript
class RealTimeAnalysisService {
  private model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-flash" });

  async analyzeAnswer(
    question: string, candidateAnswer: string,
    role: string, techStack: string[], level: string
  ): Promise<AnswerAnalysis> {
    // Step 1: Check for inadequate responses
    if (this.isInadequateResponse(candidateAnswer)) {
      return { score: 0, feedback: "No substantive answer...", ... };
    }
    // Step 2: Generate ideal answer and evaluate candidate response
    const prompt = `You are a world-class technical interviewer...
      STEP 1: Generate the IDEAL/PERFECT answer...
      STEP 2: Compare candidate's answer against the ideal...
      STEP 3: Score using strict criteria (0-10)...`;
    const result = await this.model.generateContent(prompt);
    // Step 3: Parse and return structured analysis
    return { score, feedback, correctAnswer, strengths, weaknesses, suggestions };
  }
}
```

**VAPI Voice Interview Service (from `lib/vapi.ts`):**

The `VapiService` class manages the complete voice interview lifecycle:

```typescript
export class VapiService {
  private vapi: Vapi;
  private isSessionActive = false;
  private currentQuestionIndex = 0;
  private readonly QUESTION_TIMEOUT = 60000; // 60 seconds

  async startInterviewSession(interviewConfig: {
    role: string; level: string; type: string;
    questions: string[]; currentQuestionIndex: number;
  }) {
    this.questions = interviewConfig.questions;
    await this.vapi.start(VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID);
    setTimeout(() => this.askCurrentQuestion(), 2000);
  }

  askCurrentQuestion() {
    // Set 60-second timeout for unanswered questions
    this.questionTimer = setTimeout(() => {
      this.handleUnansweredQuestion(); // Score 0
    }, this.QUESTION_TIMEOUT);
    // Deliver question via voice
    this.vapi.send({
      type: "add-message",
      message: { role: "assistant",
        content: `Question ${index}: ${currentQuestion}` }
    });
  }
}
```

**Speech Coaching with Multi-Key Rotation (from `lib/speech/coachingFeedback.ts`):**

```typescript
export async function generateCoachingFeedback(
  transcript: string, metrics: SpeechMetrics,
  question: string, fillerFrequency: number
): Promise<EnhancedCoachingFeedback & { isFallback: boolean }> {
  const apiKeys = getApiKeys(); // Supports up to 5 Gemini API keys
  const maxAttempts = apiKeys.length * 2; // 2 passes through all keys

  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: apiKeys[attempt % apiKeys.length] });
    try {
      const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
        model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
        contents: prompt,
        config: { responseMimeType: 'application/json', temperature: 0.3 }
      });
      // Blend filler score: 70% deterministic + 30% AI evaluation
      data.evaluationScores.fillerWordFrequency = Math.round(
        deterministicFiller * 0.70 + aiFiller * 0.30
      );
      return { ...data, isFallback: false };
    } catch (error) {
      if (isRateLimitError(error)) {
        await sleep(backoffMs); // Exponential backoff
      }
    }
  }
  return fallbackResponse; // Graceful degradation
}
```
